Just thought of sharing something about writing tests with JavaScript. Usually, it's best to keep tests simple and test just one thing per test (the _thing_ is most of the time just a _function_).

If we use functions we're about to test the way we use them in real programs, tests can get very lengthy and complicated easily. Usually we'll have to write more boilerplate code than real test code. And even worse, tests may fail for the _wrong reason_. As a really simple example, assume we want to test the constructor here.

```js
function Person(name) {
  this._validateName(name);
  this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype._validateName = function (name) {
  assert.equal(typeof name, "string");
};
```

This is how I used to write tests.

```js
describe("constructor", function () {
  it("should validate the name", function () {
    var original = Person.prototype._validateName;
    Person.prototype._validateName = function (name) {
      this.name__ = name;
    };
    var person = new Person("name");
    assert.equal(person.name__, "name");
    Person.prototype._validateName = original;
  });

  it("should save the name", function () {
    var person = new Person("name");
    assert.equal(person.name, "name");
  });
});
```

When testing certain parts, I had to temporarily change the prototype and restore it after the test. And I also had to consider the rest of the program too. In this example, I must make sure the `name` is a string, otherwise it'll throw an error and tests will fail. What we must remember is that the constructor is only responsible for calling the validation function and not how the validation works. This can get extremely complex when dealing with large data structures.

Thanks to JavaScript `function.call`, we can isolate the function we're about to test from the rest of the class/prototype. We can write tests like this.

```js
describe("constructor", function () {
  it("should validate the name", function () {
    var person = {
      _validateName: function (name) {
        this.name__ = name;
      },
    };
    Person.call(person, 1);
    assert.equal(person.name__, 1);
  });

  it("should save the name", function () {
    var person = { _validateName: Function.prototype };
    Person.call(person, 1);
    assert.equal(person.name, 1);
  });
});
```

As an added advantage, we can clearly see what other parts the function interacts with and how it interacts with other parts of the program.
