        _most_ of the OS defaults as is. The operating system UI is really

Elementary OS is one of the most beautiful operating systems I've ever used. Usually I mod my OS extremely but for the first time, I left _most_ of the OS defaults as is. The operating system UI is really minimal and if you use **wingpanel-slim** with auto-hide you can save even more screen space.

But when I enabled it in elementary tweaks, it worked after a few tries but never worked on system boot. Then I came across a blog post in UbuntuHandbook.com about [customizing the top panel in elementary OS](http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2013/10/customize-elementaryos-panel/). But I'm more interested in a comment made by the author. He says, in order to make sure wingpanel-slim (elementary OS top panel) tweak work, we must edit an entry in Cerbere section in Elementary Tweaks app. Works perfectly.
