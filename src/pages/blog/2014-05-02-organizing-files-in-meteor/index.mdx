Starting hacking on a project with Meteor is lots of fun. But things can become a mess very easily. Meteor does not have too much restrictions on how to organize our project files but it'll be useful to know some of its ways.

### “packages” directory

This is where all `meteor` and `atmosphere` packages are stored. And it's a good place to store your own packages. If your projects contain any parts which does not change often and mostly independent from the rest of your project, you can create a package for that.

Another advantage of using packages is _namespacing_. Global variables you create inside packages are only available inside the package. Variables must be manually exported to other parts of your application using the package.json file.

_If you're writing packages, also try testing them using tinytest. It's really easy to test with tinytest and it comes with Meteor by default._

### “client” and “server” directories

Files which goes under `client` directory runs only on clients and files under `server` runs only on the server. Which means, no need to wrap everything you write inside a giant if statement like this.

```
if (Meteor.isClient()) {
    ...
}

```

And the most important thing is that you can use `client` and `server` inside other directories. Let's say you have several modules in your projects and each have their own `client` or `server` directory or both, you can arrange them like this (if you like to) or make up your own way to organize files using `client` and `server` directories.

```
/
+---blog/
|   +---posts/
|   |   +---client/
|   |   |   +---postsView.html
|   |   |   +---postsView.less
|   |   |   +---postsView.js
|   |   |
|   |   +---both
|   |   |   +---validatePost.js
|   |   |
|   |   +---server/
|   |       +---collections.js
|   |       +---publications.js
|   |
|   +---gallery/
|       +---client/
|           +---imageGallery.html
|           +---imageGallery.js
|           +---imageGallery.less
|
+---user/
|   +---client/
|   +---server/
|
+---search/
    +---server/
        +---searchPostsMethod.js

```

In above example, the project contains 3 modules blog, user and search.

- Search module only has a Meteor method so it needs files to run only on server.
- User module can have both client side and server side code.
- Blog module has two sub modules posts and gallery.
- Gallery sub module only has client side code.
- Posts sub-module has both client and server side code.
- Posts sub-module also has a file common to both server and client.
