It's really easy to create a new empty git branch with no parents (AKA orphan branches). First create an orphan branch with this command.

```bash
git checkout --orphan newbranch
```

Now you can remove any files in the directory and finally push it to a Github repository.

```bash
git rm -rf *
git push origin newbranch
```

If you create branch in Github it'll create the branch from **master** (which is what you're going to do most of the time). Sometimes it makes more sense to create new branches. Example:

- Documentations
- Code Rewrites
- Github Pages

I learned this a while ago from a [Github Post](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually).
